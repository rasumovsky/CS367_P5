Directions: answer the following five (5) questions.  Note: some of the 
questions may require you to know how the LinkedList class is implemented; in 
these cases, you should make a reasonable assumption and clearly indicate your
assumptions in your answer.

1) Suppose you insert an item into your hashtable and then immediately do a 
lookup on that item.  What is the worst-case complexity of your program for 
the lookup in this situation?  Briefly explain your answer.

Answer: The worst-case would be all items hashed to the same index. If the item
		is at the last of the list, the worst-case complexity would be O(N).

For questions 2 - 4, you should use the TestHash program as written.

2) In this question you will run MapBenchmark four times using the parameters 
indicated below:
	run1		 randIn1000.txt 100
	run2		 randIn2000.txt 100
	run3 		randIn10000.txt 100

What is the output for each of the runs?  

Answer:


3) In this question you will again run TestHash four times, this time using the 
parameters:
	run4		 badIn1000.txt 100
	run5		 badIn2000.txt 100
	run6 		badIn10000.txt 100

What is the output for each of the runs?  

Answer:

4) Briefly analyze your results from questions 2 and 3. Consider the 
following aspects:
	- underlying data structure
	- the number of inputs
	- the input file
How do these aspects influence the statistics? How do the table statistics 
affect the performance (times)? 

Answer:

5) Using the above data, give the complexity of each SimpleMapADT method for 
SimpleTreeMap and SimpleHashMap.  Justify your answer with your run results.

Answer:
